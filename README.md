# group_activity
Through this activity, we will work in groups to develop HTML files that showcase text, images, and links supporting topics of interest in either sports, social issues such as economic disparities or community health, or another topic of your team's choice. 

While completing the additions, commits and pulls between your local and remote repos will be useful to reduce conflicts and improve overall presentation.

Please work closely with your teammates, each person taking either the P1, P2, P3, or P4 assignments noted in the HTML code and based on the designations provided prior to the breakout rooms.

Finally, you may need HTML markdown syntax information for this activity, most of which can be found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/.

Enjoy!!!
